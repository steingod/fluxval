STATUS
======
Passage and daily estimates are now validated against Bioforsk stations
using the same executable but different command line options.


TODO
====
  - Extract handling of cloud mask and observation geometry for passage
    products into separate functions to create a nicer software outline.
  - Add support for DLI estimates and observations.
  - Add support for iAOOS-data.
